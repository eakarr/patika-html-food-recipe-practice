      </h1>
      <p>
        These homemade crepes are ultra thin and delicate with the most buttery
        crisp edges. Easy to make with just a blender and regular skillet,
        they’re ready for your choice of sweet or savory fillings and toppings.
        No special pans required for these French-style pancakes. And, best part
        of all, you only need 8 basic ingredients!

          Overview: How to Make Crepes
        </h2>
        <div>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Melt the butter:</b> Melt some butter in the microwave or on
                the stove. Let it cool for a few minutes before using in the
                batter. (Otherwise you could scramble the eggs.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Combine all ingredients in a blender:</b> Add the cooled
                melted butter and all the remaining ingredients into a blender.
                A blender works WONDERFULLY to smooth out the batter because it
                cuts that flour perfectly into all the wet ingredients. If you
                don’t have a blender, just use a mixing bowl and whisk.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Chill the batter:</b> Chill the crepe batter for at least
                30-60 minutes before cooking it. This time in the refrigerator
                is crucial to the taste, texture, and success of your crepes.
                Use this time to clean up and get your skillet ready. You can
                even chill the batter overnight so it’s ready to cook the next
                day.

            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Butter & heat a small skillet:</b> Generously butter the pan
                and keep butter nearby for greasing the pan between each crepe
                too. Though professional chefs may use a specialty crepe pan, I
                find a small 8-inch skillet works perfectly at home. If you
                don’t have a small skillet, use a larger one but make sure you
                keep the crepes THIN.

                <b>Cook crepes one at a time:</b> The longest part of this
                recipe is standing over the stove and cooking them one at a time
                over medium heat. Use only 3-4 Tablespoons of batter per crepe.
                (I usually use 3 Tablespoons.) The less you use and the larger
                you stretch the crepe, the thinner they’ll be. As you can see in
                my video tutorial above, I twirl the pan so the batter stretches
                as far as it can go. If you don’t do this, your crepes will be
                pretty thick and taste like tortillas. Still delicious, but very
                different. Flip the crepe over and cook the other side, too.

                <b>Serve with favorite fillings:</b> I love serving them warm
                with cold whipped cream and fresh berries. Keep scrolling
                because I have lots of filling ideas listed for you below.
